# Vote-App


Hi guys  ,
 I've done a mini project titled voting App with the help of front end languages like HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for responsive web design. Javascript has also been used in this .I am providing the link to it.
Kindly tryout this below link and read the entire description to access it without any hurdles.

Description : 
The main idea behind the  project is used to select any one of the candidate from the two candidates listed on each page. This process will be continued for the next 3 pages .In the last page you will be able to view the candidates that you have selected in the previous 3 pages

The basic validation is also completed in this, 
1) In login screen , provide the unique number as your phone number.  Unique number and password must be same 
2) length of the unique number and password must be 10 ( It should not exceed more or less than that )
 3) select any one of the candidate from each page
 4) If you click next button without selecting the candidate,  system will throw an alert box to the user. This functionality has been  incorporated in all the pages
